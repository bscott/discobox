description: Recipe for verifying a CLI or console (TUI) change against the running `task dev` loop inside a discobox — opening the console in an isolated tmux, signalling it, and forcing a real out-of-memory kill. Use when verifying a change to the discobox console, its terminal guard, or anything reached from bare `./build/discobox`.
---

# Verifying the console

Read `.agents/skills/test-fix/driving-task-dev.md` first: the dev loop is
already running, and every CLI call needs `--server http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
Confirm `build/discobox` is newer than your last edit before driving it.

## Open the console

Bare `discobox` opens the console without creating a box; it is the cheapest
way to reach `runConsole` (and the terminal guard it starts).

```bash
tmux -L verify new-session -d -s v -x 150 -y 40 -c "$PWD" \
  "env -u DISCOBOX_SERVER PS1='\$ ' bash --norc --noprofile"
tmux -L verify send-keys -t v './build/discobox --server http://127.0.0.1:8080; echo "exit=$?"' Enter
tmux -L verify capture-pane -p -t v
```

The console is `pgrep -f '^./build/discobox --server'`; its guard is
`pgrep -f 'admin console-guard'` (`pgrep -f` also matches your own tool shell,
so filter it out). Ctrl-C at the welcome screen quits it normally.

## Gotchas

- `sudo` works without a password in the box.
- A real kernel OOM kill: `sudo mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/<name>`, move the pane's
  shell (`tmux list-panes -F '#{pane_pid}'`) into its `cgroup.procs`, open the
  console, then set `memory.swap.max` to 0 and lower `memory.max` to a few MB.
  Without the swap limit the kernel swaps instead of killing. `rmdir` the
  cgroup after the tmux server is gone.
- bpftrace is not installed: `nix build --no-link --print-out-paths
  nixpkgs#bpftrace`. Inside a box, `args->pid` on a tracepoint is the host's
  pid, not the box's.
- `sudo pkill -f <pattern>` kills your own tool shell when the pattern is in
  its command line; kill by pid instead.
- Kill the tmux server (`tmux -L verify kill-server`) when done.
