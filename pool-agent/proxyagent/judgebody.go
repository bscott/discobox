// The first ask describes the body: its media type and length and, when a
// parser recognizes it, what that parser found worth knowing — the refs a push
// changes, the fields a form sends — which is small and is what the operation
// is. When the judge answers that it needs the body itself, the next ask shows
// it: redacted, rendered the way its parser renders it, cut to the budget, and
// with a sentence saying what is not there and why. The judge never picks how

// is sent — the proxy hands back every byte this read, in front of the rest.
