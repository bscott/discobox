// Recognizing a request before it is judged (ADR 26-09-26-240 §1).
//
// The proxy knows a body only as a media type and a length, and the judge only
// as bytes; nothing between them knows what a protocol or an API means by it.
// Recognition is that knowledge, on two independent axes: the protocol a
// request speaks, whatever host it goes to, and the endpoint it calls on one
// API. Each is a built-in, ordered registry — structured to be added to, not
// configured. Nothing a request, a sandbox, or a use says adds to it.
//
// Recognition only adds information. The sandbox writes every byte, so a
// request can claim to be anything; one that claims a protocol and does not
// parse as it is shown as having failed to (judge.Body.ParseError), which the
// judge weighs, and never quietly described as something weaker.

// protocol is a wire protocol a request may speak.
