// Package agentcreds is the agent credentials protocol: the portable
// list/request/get contract an agent inside a sandbox uses to ask a human for a
// credential it was not provisioned with, and then to use it.
//
// The package knows nothing about Discobox. It carries the wire types, a
// client, and an http.Handler over a Service interface, so the same in-sandbox
// CLI works against Discobox's sandbox-agent and against any other
// implementation of Service.
//
// The value Get returns is deliberately unspecified: an implementation may
// return the real credential, and Discobox returns an ephemeral sentinel its
// egress proxy exchanges for the real value on the way out. Callers must treat
// it as opaque and stop using it after ExpiresAt.
//
// See docs/agent-credentials-protocol.md and
// docs/adr/0031-agent-credentials-are-a-portable-protocol-with-ephemeral-sentinels.md.
