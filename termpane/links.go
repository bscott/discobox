// WithLinkRewrite decides where a link drawn in the pane actually points.
//
// It is for a pane whose terminal is somewhere else. A server inside a sandbox
// prints the address it is listening on — `http://localhost:8080` — and that
// address is true where it was printed and false where it is read: the port
// reachable here is whatever the forward bound, and `0.0.0.0` is not an address
// a browser can open at all. The text on the screen belongs to the application
// and is left exactly as it printed it; only where a click goes is the host's.
//
// The function is called with a URL and returns the URL to use. Returning the
// one it was given means "this is already right", and is the answer for
// everything the host does not recognize.
//
// It governs two things:
//
//   - Every OSC 8 target an application in the pane emitted passes through it,
//     so a link the application made itself lands where it meant.
//   - Plain text that looks like a URL becomes a link when — and only when —
//     the function moves it. Text nothing moves is left as text, which is the
//     point: the terminal drawing the pane does its own URL detection, and
//     overriding it everywhere to say the same thing would take a working link
//     away to give it back. A link is added exactly where the text lies.
//
// Detection is scheme-led (`http://`, `https://`) and stops at the row, so a
// URL wrapped across the right edge is not one.
