// `diff.external`, and a textconv filter are all ways `.git/config` runs a
// command of the repository's choosing instead of git's. None of the calls
// this file makes ever diffs or shows a patch, so none of them is reachable
// today — the guard is here so that stays true if one is added later, not
// because today's calls need it.
