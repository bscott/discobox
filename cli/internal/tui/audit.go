// The audit screen is one discobox's audit trails as a single timeline,
// followed: what `discobox admin audit list --follow` prints, as a list to move
// through. The leader opens it from the workspace and it is drawn over the
// workspace the way a tool window is — the terminals underneath keep running,
// unresized — and Enter opens the highlighted record in full, as
// `discobox admin audit get` prints it, on the scrolling card the help is read
// on.
//
// The timeline reads the way the command's does: oldest at the top, newest at
// the bottom, and the cursor riding the newest record while it is following.
// Moving off the newest stops the cursor there — a record arriving must never
// move the row being read — and moving back down to it, or End, follows again.
//
// Consecutive records that have the same Group — http exchanges with one
// method, status and origin, which is what an agent polling or paging an API
// looks like — fold into one row that counts them. Enter or → opens the run to
// its records and ← folds it again; Enter on a record opens it in full. A run
// is only ever consecutive records: one from another trail in between is part
// of what happened, and folding across it would reorder the timeline.
//
// Which trails, and how they are read, is the command's answer rather than
// this screen's (DataSource.FollowAudit): the two are one reader, so what the
// console shows and what the command prints cannot drift apart.
