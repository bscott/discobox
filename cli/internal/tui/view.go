// The header's filters — server, folder, tag — are kept per folder, the way
// the draft is: a window opens on every server, every folder and every tag in
// a directory it has never been narrowed in, and on whatever it was left on in
// one it has. The folder is the session's own directory, so narrowing the list
// in one checkout says nothing about the next.
//
// Where they are kept is the DataSource's business (SaveView). The window's
// part is when, which is when the draft is written: on the listing's clock
// while it is open, and on the way out.

// restoreView puts the header back on what the last window in this folder left
// it on. A server that is no longer registered is every server, since a filter
// naming nothing on the list would list nothing.
//
// With nothing saved, the default is everything, narrowed by what the command
// line named: --server is the primary, and -C is the window's own folder. That
// narrowing is where the window opens, not a choice made in it, so it is what
// the store is taken to have — it is saved only once the filters move off it.
