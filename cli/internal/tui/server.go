// The server is the widest of the header filter's three (filter.go): it says
// which server's discoboxes are on screen, and — because the server you are
// looking at is the server you are about to create on — which server the
// prompt runs on. One control, not two that happen to agree, the same way the
// folder is both the list's filter and the source a create cuts from.
//
// It opens on every server, which is the listing ADR 0116 §4 describes: seeing
// several machines at once is the point of registering them, and a window that
// hid the others until asked would be the one-server-at-a-time client that ADR
// rejected. Narrowing to one is what the filter is for — a long list cut down
// to the machine being worked on, and a create that follows the eye.
//
// It is only offered when there is more than one server to choose (ADR 0116
// §5), which is the same condition the list groups under and the run options
// offer their Server row under: naming the one server there is says nothing.

// allServers is the choice that is not a server: every discobox the window can
// reach, in its sections. It leads the servers, where "all folders" trails the
// folders, for the one reason either order has — the choice the window opens
// on is the one to lead with, and this is where the window opens.
