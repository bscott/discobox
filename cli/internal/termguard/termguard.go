// Package termguard puts a terminal back the way it was found when the process
// that took it over dies without doing so itself.
//
// A full-screen program leaves the terminal in raw mode, on the alternate
// screen, and reporting the mouse, and only the program can undo that. Bubble
// Tea undoes it on every exit it sees — a quit, a signal it handles, a panic in
// Update, View or a command — but a process can end without Bubble Tea seeing
// it: a panic in any other goroutine (its own renderer and input reader
// included), a runtime fatal error such as a concurrent map write, os.Exit, or
// SIGKILL. What that leaves behind is the last frame, no echo or a shell that
// has adopted raw mode, and a mouse whose every movement is typed at the
// prompt as an escape sequence.
//
// Nothing inside the process can cover all of those, so the guard is a second
// process: the same binary, re-run as a hidden command, holding the read end of
// a pipe whose write end only the program holds. The kernel closes that pipe
// however the program ends, so the guard always hears about it. A program that
// finished properly writes one byte first; a pipe that closes without it is a
// program that died, and the guard restores the terminal and says why.
//
// Why is the hard part, since the guard never sees the program die. A runtime
// crash leaves a report (below). The one signal that ends a Go program
// silently and can be caught is SIGHUP — the runtime ignores the other
// catchable ones, traces the rest into the report, and Bubble Tea handles
// SIGINT and SIGTERM itself — so the program catches it, writes its name down
// the lifeline, and dies of it as it would have. On Linux the guard also
// watches its cgroup's count of the kernel out-of-memory killer's kills, and
// blames it for a death that comes with a rise. Where that count is there to
// read, what is left is a SIGKILL from another process or an exit that skipped
// Release, and the guard says so and how to catch the sender; where it is not,
// the guard can only say the console was killed without warning. A kill that
// takes the whole cgroup (systemd-oomd, memory.oom.group) takes the guard too,
// and nothing is said.
//
// The program also points the runtime's crash output (debug.SetCrashOutput) at
// a temporary file. A trace printed to the alternate screen is gone the moment
// the screen is switched back, so the file is where it survives; the guard
// names it in one line rather than reprinting it, since a trace of every
// goroutine runs to a thousand lines and would scroll everything else away.
