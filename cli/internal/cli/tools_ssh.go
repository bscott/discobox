The server needs no SSH port for this: ssh reaches it over the same endpoint
the API uses, by running this CLI as its ProxyCommand. Proxy, user, key, and
host verification are all supplied here, so nothing is written to your
ssh_config. The key is the one exception — it is
enrolled in the project, and reused rather than replaced on later runs.

Every argument is passed to ssh untouched, including flags. A leading argument
that names one of this directory's discoboxes selects it; anything else, and
everything after it, belongs to ssh.`,
		Example: `  discobox tools ssh
  discobox tools ssh mybox
  discobox tools ssh -L 8080:localhost:3000
  discobox tools ssh mybox -- uname -a`,
		// Flag parsing is off entirely, not just SetInterspersed(false): ssh's
		// own flags come first in the common case (`discobox tools ssh -L ...`),

//
// The difference from `shell` is that flag parsing is off here, so args[0] may
// be an ssh flag — `discobox tools ssh -L 8080:localhost:3000` is the ordinary
// case. A leading `-` is never a sandbox reference, and matchSandboxArg
// (inside resolveShellTarget) rejects anything that does not name one of this
// directory's sandboxes, so everything else reaches ssh untouched.
//
// --discobox-id wins outright when given: it was said explicitly, and then no
// argument is consumed as a sandbox at all.
